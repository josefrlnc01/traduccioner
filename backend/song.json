" Help! I need somebody Help! Not just anybody Help! You know I need someone Help! When I was young I was so much younger than today I never needed anybody's help in any way Now but now these days are gone I'm not so self assured Now I find the general mind I'll open up the doors Help me if you can I'm feeling down And I do appreciate you being around Help me get my feet back on the ground Won't you please, please help me Now and now my life has changed in so many ways My independence seems to vanish in the haze But every now and then I feel so insecure I know that I just need your light I've never done before Help me if you can I'm feeling down And I do appreciate you being around Help me get my feet back on the ground Won't you please, please help me When I was young I was so much younger than today I never needed anybody's help in any way Now but now these days are gone I'm not so self assured Now I find the general mind I'll open up the doors Help me if you can I'm feeling down And I do appreciate you being around Help me get my feet back on the ground Won't you please, please help me Help me, help me"
