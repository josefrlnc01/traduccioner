"纹 I would have given it to you, you know what love is I would have done it with you And I don't know why, I'm here, oh no no no Under the beach I'll wait for you, even if they shoot me I could give my life, you looked like a little girl You dressed white as a cocaine, you were my baby I kept you between my arms, together in the morning But things went wrong, they went before you I was telling you, I wanted to show you, half the bastards were thinking There was the shit, how to escape, make some money to not come back I gave my heart, the company is hot The company is hot, you who beat me, you who like me Without those tacks, without tricking you, I did a thousand things for you But I did, zero things for us, for me, I did it like this I only want if you treat me badly You remember the sea, I alone and I discovered the paradise where it is And now you're no longer there, but you have to know that That you would have had a heart I would have given it to you, you know what love is I would have done it with you, and I don't know why I'm here, oh no, no, no, under the beach I'll wait for you Even if they shoot me, that if you had a heart I would have given it to you, you know what love is I would have done it with you, and I don't know why I'm here, oh no, no, no, under the beach I'll wait for you Even if they shoot me I would have done it with you, you know what love is"
