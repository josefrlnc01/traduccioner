" You're on the phone your girlfriend she's upset she's going off about something that you said she doesn't get your humor like I do I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like and she'll never know your story like I do But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts, she's chair captain and I'm on the bleachers, screaming about the thing The new egg I've been finding what you're looking for has been here the whole time if you could see the time no one would want to stand you Been here all along so I can't you see you belong with me You belong with me Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans I cannot think in this as how it ought to be Lapping on a plug bench thinking to myself hey isn't this easy? And you've got a smile that can light up this old town I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down You say you find I know you better than that and what you're doing with a girl like that She wears high heels, I wear sneakers, she's chair captain and I'm on the bleachers, screaming about the day The new egg I've been finding what you're looking for has been here the whole time if you could see the time no one would want to stand you Been here all along so I can't you see you belong with me You've been inside a waiting natural factor on this town I could you not know maybe You belong with me You belong with me Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night I know what it makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry and know your favorite songs And you tell me about your dreams think I know where you belong Think I know it's with me Can't you see the town with the one who understands you been here all along so I can't you see You belong with me Standing by you waiting at your back door on this town I could you not know maybe You belong with me You belong with me You belong with me Have you ever thought just me? You belong with me You belong with me"
