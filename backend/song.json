" You're on the phone. Your girlfriend, she's upset. She's going off about something that you said. She doesn't get your humor like I do. I'm in the room. It's a typical Tuesday. I'm listening to the kind of music she does and black and she'll never know your story like I do. But she wears short skirts, high wear t-shirts, she's chair captain and I'm on the bleachers, screaming not to be. The new egg I've been finding, what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see that I'm the one who wants to set you been here all along so I can't you see. You belong with me. You belong with me. Walking the streets with you and your worn out jeans. I cannot think in this as how it ought to be. Lapping on a park bench, thinking to myself, Hey isn't this easy? And you've got a smile that can light up this old town I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down. You say you find I know you better than that. And what you're doing with a girl like that. She wears high heels, high wear sneakers, she's chair captain and I'm on the bleachers, screaming not to be. The new egg I've been finding, what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see that I'm the one who wants to set you been here all along so I can't you see. You belong with me. You. Stand and fight, we're in natural fact. You're on this town, how could you not know maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me. Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night. I know what you make you laugh when you know you're about to cry. I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams. Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me. Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you been here all along so I can't you see. You belong with me. Stand and fight, we're in natural fact. You're on this town, how could you not know maybe. Stand and fight, we're in natural fact. You're on this town, how could you not know maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me. You belong with me. Have you ever thought just maybe. You belong with me. You belong with me."
